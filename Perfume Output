Customized Organic Perfume Monthly Subscription
1.	Identify the problem
Perfume is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or fragrances, fixatives and solvents, usually in liquid form.  Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of fragrance compounds. Two types of ingredients are used in perfume and they are natural (derived from plant materials) and synthetic (created through chemical synthesis). 

Natural ingredients have been used since the beginning of perfumery. Various methods are used to extract and concentrate the fragrant parts into raw materials. Depending on the method of extraction, the resulting raw material will be an essential oil, absolute, or CO2 extract. In the late 19th century perfumers began using synthetic ingredients, which allowed them to expand their palettes beyond natural oils and absolutes. With these materials perfumers can reinvent naturally occurring smells and create entirely new scents. Synthetic ingredients make up to 80% of many modern perfumes. Fragrances are made of raw materials that have different rates of evaporation. Raw materials are classified as top, middle or base notes according to their volatility. Most fragrances are built with a combination of top, middle and base notes to balance the fragrance as it evolves over time. 

•	Top notes (high volatility + low tenacity—they evaporate the fastest)
Top notes are the scents that detect first after spraying a perfume. Top notes usually evaporate quickly, remain for only the first five to fifteen minutes. Their main purpose is to give off an initial scent and then transition smoothly into the next part of the fragrance. As a result, top notes generally consist of lighter and smaller molecules. 

•	Middle notes (intermediate volatility and tenacity)
The middle notes or modifiers add complexity to a fragrance. Because they make up around 50 percent of the total scent, middle notes usually last longer than top notes. Middle notes appear as the top notes start to fade. 

•	Base notes (low volatility + high tenacity—they last the longest)
Base notes are what help the middle notes last longer. They accentuate and extend the longevity of the middle notes. Along with middle notes, base notes form the foundation of the fragrance. The base notes will determine the main characteristics of a fragrance.

 

Perfume products vary in price because they vary in strength and they are classified by strength as well. The fragrance concentration of a particular perfume refers to the fragrance’s strength. The higher the concentration the purer the fragrance. It contains a greater amount of perfume oils therefore the cost of the fragrance is greater. Besides, the greater the concentration of perfume oils the longer the perfume lasts on the wearers which is usually referred to as tenacity.

Organic perfumes are better than synthetic perfumes. Organic perfumes are made from 100% naturally-sourced ingredients, usually plant-based, and extracted without chemical intervention. Organic perfumes do not contain ingredients grown with chemicals, pesticides or toxins, which can cause skin sensitivity and environmental damage. Organic perfumes are simply a better choice for our health and for the environment.

Customization is the action of making or changing something according to the buyer's or user's needs. It is also defined as to make or change something to personal or unique specifications. Personalized or customized perfumes is where customers can choose the ingredients they prefer and order the perfume. They can experience their favorite fragrance by choosing the ingredients from top note, middle note and base note. 

From the UUM Hostel Management feedback, there are many unused perfumes that are thrown into the trash bins. Some students throw away the unused perfumes because certain fragrances causes health problems like migraines, headaches and respiratory difficulties. Different students have different level of fragrance sensitivity, so they need to use perfumes in which the ingredients suits them. Some students do not like synthetic perfumes and looking for organic perfumes that do not cause health problems. Some students throw away the unused perfumes because they do not like the readymade fragrance and prefer customized fragrance. Because of the large amount of perfume in a bottle, students unable to finish the perfume before the expiry date and some students throw away the old unused perfume after they change to the new one. The used perfume bottles which are empty now are also thrown away and increases the amount of waste in the hostel area. 

Besides, due to the longer distance from UUM to town, it is difficult for students to get the perfume each time when it has finishes or when the students want to change the perfume. So, students need to purchase the perfumes each and every time by going to the cosmetic shops or shopping malls. This increases the travelling cost of students and also the time taken to purchase it. 

Because of this, the management plans to develop a system where students can get their customized organic perfumes every month with only one subscription. Students can choose whether to try out a sample 2ml of perfume or buy a full bottle of perfume. The top, middle and base notes of the perfumes will be displayed differently for male and female. The users need to select the top, middle and base notes of the perfume, strength of the perfume and also the amount of perfume whether 10ml, 15ml or 20ml. That selected perfume will be delivered to the user every month. This reduces the wastage of unused perfumes where that amount of perfume is sufficient for 1 month. If the user desires to change the customized perfume for the following month, they can change it by selecting the 3 notes using the system. There will be discount provided with the exchange of empty perfume bottles from students. This reduces the wastage of empty perfume bottles. The user also can design the perfume for the next month.  The user can pause the perfume subscription plan for 1 to 6 months or unsubscribe the plan. The same perfume will be delivered for next month if the user does not want to design the perfume for next month.

       2.0 	Understand the problem

Some students throw away the unused perfumes because certain fragrances causes health problems. A person might have a fragrance sensitivity to certain odors that irritate the senses, causing allergy-like symptoms such as migraines, headaches and respiratory difficulties, when exposed to fragranced products. Some experts estimate that as many as 30% of all people may have sensitivities to certain odors. Besides, synthetic perfumes contains chemicals which might also cause health issues. Because of this, students throw away the unused perfumes if they face these types of health issues after using the perfume. Different students have different level of fragrance sensitivity. So, they need to select the ingredients used for making a customized perfume for them.

Students throw away the unused perfumes if they do not like or prefer the readymade fragrance. Perfumes that are no longer used become waste and thrown away into the trash bins. This increases the amount of waste in hostel area. Perfumes are considered as hazardous wastes. If there is still perfume in the bottle it is considered Household Hazardous Waste (HHW). Household hazardous waste (HHW) must not be included in curbside garbage, recycling collection, or poured down the drain. HHW, if not disposed of properly, can be harmful to people, animals and the environment. In addition, empty bottles of perfumes are also thrown away. It increases the amount of wastes when the used and empty perfume bottles are thrown away. The students prefer to use personalized or customized organic perfumes rather than readymade perfumes. 

Students money is being waste for unused perfumes. Because they do not like the readymade fragrance, they do not use the perfume and purchase the other perfume. Besides, some students couldn’t finish the perfume bottle before the expiry date. Because of the larger amount of perfume in a bottle, they couldn’t finish it before expiry date and thus their money will be wasted for that unused perfume. Because of this, students need accurate amount of perfume so that they can finish using the perfume before expiry date. 

Students need to purchase every time when they desire to change the perfume or when it has finished by going to the shop. This Increases the time taken of students to purchase the perfume. Travelling cost of students also increases because of the longer distance to purchase the perfumes. 

Moreover, billing miscalculation might happen when calculating the price manually using calculator. The price of the organic perfumes is also higher. Basically, organic refers to any product whose ingredients are naturally grown without the use of any kind of artificial chemicals. That said, organic perfume is defined as any fragrance whose ingredients have been manufactured solely from natural products. Because of the natural ingredients, the price of organic perfume is higher compare to synthetic perfume.

6.0     Evaluate the solution
By using this system, students can customize their perfume by choosing their favorite ingredients from top note, middle note and also base note. They also can customize the strength of each notes by choosing lower strength, medium strength or higher strength. By choosing the ingredients for customized perfume, health problems like headache can be reduced. This is because, students can select the ingredients according to their fragrance sensitivity. Besides, students can get organic perfume with lower price. Organic perfumes are better than synthetic perfumes in term of health. By using the perfume monthly subscription system, the wastage of unused perfume and empty perfume bottles can be reduced. This system also helps students to reduce the amount of money wasted due to the unused perfume. This is because, students can try a free sample 2ml of perfume or buy the full bottle perfume. If they choose to buy a full bottle, 10 ml, 15 ml or 20 ml of perfume will be given to students each month after they have subscribed and it is sufficient for 1 month. They will get another perfume with the same amount for the next month without ordering. This reduces the wastage of perfumes that are no longer used. Users also can adjust the frequency of delivery with full flexibility. The top, middle and base notes of the perfumes will be displayed differently for male and female. Users’ next order will automatically be placed on the same order date next month. This system is flexible because users can change the type of perfume to be delivered in the following month. With this, they can experience different types of perfumes. They also can pause or unsubscribe the plan. There will be discount provided with the exchange of empty perfume bottles from students. This reduces the wastage of empty perfume bottles.
